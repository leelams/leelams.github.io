<title> leela's (quarentine) journal</title>
<p class="para"> may 24, 2020<br><br>i'm starting a new coding journal for quarentine to document my coding during quarentine! i've had a bit of time to revisit older games that i liked. </p>
<p class="para"> may 30, 2020<br><br>i have the code finished for my randomizing comic strip creator, but i don't have the software in quarentine thay i'd like to make the actual comics :(</p>
<p class="para"> april 8, 2020<br><br>one thing that i've been trying to do is to fix an old game i made that has been experiencing a lot of glitches. what was happening was that divs would go to a spot that alternated every time i refreshed the game, one being the spot i wanted them to go to, and the other was not. i ended up having to experiment a lot with the code by  making a copy of the game and messing around with it. eventually, i was able to fix this issue as a result of this trial and error. </p>
<p class="para"> april 16, 2020<br><br>i've made a lot of new updates to my escape the room game. one is that i've made a virtual puzzle. this works by having twelve puzzle pieces, and twelve invisible divs set to the center of one of twelve spots in a four by three grid. The code works so that if any of the puzzle pieces is touching any of the invisible divs, they will lock into a certain spot. This works so that they puzzle pieces don't just get freely dragged around, and also so that the code can "tell" when the puzzle has been solved correctly, because each piece will be touching the invisible div that it corresponds to. one important thing that i took away from this is the different between "hide" and "set ghost affect to 100", which is what i had to do for the invisible divs. </p>
<p class="para"> april 23, 2020<br><br>i want to try to convert a scratch game into a javascript game using woofjs. this would have to be a fairly simple game, but i think  it would be educational for javascript coding experience.</p>
<p class="para"> april 30, 2020<br><br>i worked on a p5js project today (the opening example), which is somehthing that is similar to a project i've made before. i
ll add website entries for both of these, but it is like a drawing with div stamping project. before, i used a canvas element to do the  same thing. both  projects work  by  making a  copy of the div whenever the mouse pointer moves, and sending  it to the location  of the mouse  pointer, and then  staying at that location.</p>
<p class="para"> may 9, 2020<br><br>i've made a codesketch for a new project for my sister, which would work like a dress-up game. it's very simple, but i think it would be a good introduction into game making with javascript, which i definently want tp get familliar with. it would  work by having a lot of movable or clickable button divs  to generate clothes for a div of a person, and possibly a randomized array with a prompt of hpw to dress the character. if this all gies well, i could even try to add code that "recognizes" whether a piece of clothing fits the given briefing or not.</p>
<p class="para"> may 13, 2020<br><br>i'm looking into sprite compression for scratch, which is basically projects that have a really small number of divs with multiple costumes, and that serve as  multiple different divs using cloning. i think this is a really interesting way of coding, and i want to see how it would would in javascript.</p>
<p class="para"> may 18, 2020<br><br> i tried project euler problem #2 in class, but it didn't go very well. the instructions were to list all the fibonacci sequence numbers, and then select all of the even ones. i tried to use some of the code from the first project euler problem to figure out which numbers are even (this works by dividing a number by 2 and seeing whether it's a whole number or not by seeing if there's a decimal in the answer</p>
<p class="para"> may 25, 2020<br><br>i'm updating my website so it has my quarentine journal, updated versions of my existing games. also, i hope to start production for my new game today.</p>
<p class="para"> may 26, 2020<br><br> for some reason, my update didn't work :( I will try to get this fixed. in the meanwhile, my codescketch for the dress up game for my sister is coming along, and i'm getting excited. i think the continuation of the project will be a good summer activity. today, she used a pinneaple as an accessory in a photo i took of her, so i'm adding it to the game/</p>
<p class="para"> june 2, 2020<br><br>recently, we did a project where we coded with some kids from afghanistan, and i made a very simple scratch project to work as a tutorial. it is an animation of a "timid chicken". i didn't finish it, but i still thought it was pretty cute, plus it got me thinking about consolidating code again. instead of having multiple blocks, most of the animation could be done in three blocks using the repeat, forever, etc. i want to learn more about hoe to do this in line code as well.</p>
