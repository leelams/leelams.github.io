<p class="para">p5js project <br><br> unfortunately, my exact project didn't save. properly, and it was lost (r.i.p), but the explanation remains, so i'll. link it and maybe try to recreate the project later so this page is better! anyways, i thought this was a very interesting project, because i've done the same kingd if stamping divs project. before,  but using. the css canvas element, so seeing. it coded in. a different way and in a different editor was super cool. i think this one works  by  making a  copy of the div whenever the mouse pointer moves, and sending  it to the location  of the mouse  pointer, and then  staying at that location. </p>
