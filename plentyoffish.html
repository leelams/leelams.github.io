<p class= "para">here is a very rough draft of an assignment where multiple divs move. i have no idea how to use javascript, so I made something in html and css to start.</p>
<p class="para"> code sketch: <br>- make five divs from one class<br>- program class so fish go back and forth <br>- set background to blue/ocean</p>
<p class="para"> issues: <br>the current code sketch only works in css and html, and doesn't have any movement because there isn't any js. </p>
